			<p class="copy">There seems to be a general distrust of organized institutions among college students. We know that our schools have resources, but there is so much hesitation in reaching out because of past experiences that have failed us. Jumping hurdles to get the support we need or just a lack of access can be enough for students not to want to participate in their school communities. There are a lot of ways to address this institution and many students make strides in involving their school and building within their institutions. This can take a lot of time and work and on top of navigating school can be unrealistic as well as the challenges of organizing within the guides of an already established and sometimes restrictive foundation. We want to offer alternatives to this. We've compiled a guide that is meant to grow and be a hub for students in lower Manhattan, so they can access outside aid and mutual support organizations such as food banks and public spaces.</p>

			<p class="sec-title">3. Community Care ⇄ Self-Care</p>
			<p class="copy">Mainly we just want to focus on how important and challenging it is to build a community before a disaster and how that in itself is a preventative action and offer some starting points as to how to make friends with common interests with a foundation for giving back to the community. Public parks/libraries are a great place to start clubs. In these spaces, we can learn from each other, share experiences and issues, and tackle them together.</p>

			<p id="parks" class="copy">Public Parks:<br><br>Public parks are a vital resource in the busy city of New York, where you can often forget what it feels like to exist in nature, amongst the hustle and bustle of the concrete jungle. Maybe that is why New York also happens to be home to one of the most iconic parks in the world, Central Park.<br><br>The New York City Department of Parks and Recreation manages roughly 1,700 parks across all five boroughs (NYC Parks), giving New Yorkers spaces to exercise, connect with nature, cool off in the summer, and connect with their communities.<br><br>Public parks are also economically beneficial, as they “lower healthcare costs for people who exercise there, provide natural air and water filtration, increase property values, and promote tourism while serving as a place for people to connect with nature,” (Clementkhlau).<br><br>On top of their many economic benefits, Public parks also allow for a space where people can exist freely in nature, where friends can host birthday parties and gatherings, and people can support local farms and businesses through the many markets and shops often hosted in these parks. </p>

			<br><br><p id="gardens" class="copy">Community Gardens:<br><br>Public gardens are maybe not as often thought of as a staple of New York City as their counterpart the public park, however, they are just as important in maintaining a relationship with nature for the people of New York.<br><br>These staples of community building got their start in the 1970s, following an economic collapse that left many vacant lots sitting in disuse. Activists would throw “seed bombs” in hopes of beautifying the area. This was an act of eco-activism, and the efforts of these “green guerillas” were eventually recognized, leading to the establishment of the Green Thumb program.<br><br>The Green Thumb program is “the nation's largest urban gardening program, sustaining over 550 community gardens,” (NYC Parks) and helping to uplift and support local gardeners. Public gardens have been linked to increased mental health, and decreased crime rates (Platkin) for those who help to maintain them, as well as a myriad of other benefits for the communities in which they are established.<br><br>Public food gardens can help to combat food insecurity in lower-income areas (Platkin), while simultaneously providing a center for outdoor recreation and community building. On top of all this, they are beautiful to look at and provide a much-needed connection with nature in the big city.</p>
